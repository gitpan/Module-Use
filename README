NAME
    Module::Use

SYNOPSIS
    Perl
      use Module::Use (Logger => "Debug");

    mod_perl
      <Perl>
      use Module::Use (Logger => "Debug");
      </Perl>

      PerlChildExitHandler Module::Use
      PerlCleanupHandler Module::Use
      PerlLogHandler Module::Use

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Use will record the modules used over the course of the Perl
    interpreter's lifetime. If the logging module is able, the old logs are
    read and frequently used modules are automatically loaded. Note that no
    symbols are imported into packages.

    Under mod_perl, only one Perl*Handler should be selected, depending on
    when and how often logging should take place.

OPTIONS
    The following options are available when `use'ing this module.

    Count
        This is the number of times a module has been used for it to be
        automatically loaded.

    Decay
        This number is subtracted from the count of all modules that are in
        the data store but were not loaded.

    Grow
        This number is added to the count of all modules that were loaded.

    Limit
        Do not automatically load more than this many modules.

    Logger
        This is the logging module to use. Configuration is specific to the
        module chosen. Please see the documentation for the module.

        The module name is `Module::Use::Logger' with `Logger' replaced with
        the value of this option.

    Percentage
        The percentage of total module loads is used in the same manner as
        the `Count'. If both `Percentage' and `Count' are given, the one
        with the greater counts is used.
